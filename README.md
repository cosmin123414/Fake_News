# Fake_News
Basic Fake News Detector

In this project I have trained 3 classifiers (Logistic Regression, Passive Aggressive, Random Forest) to flag a news article as 'Real' or 'Fake'. I used a dataset from
the University of Victoria Information security and object technology (ISOT) research lab. See link for dataset (https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/ece/isot/datasets/fake-news/index.php).
The data processing and algorithm training can be found in the Jupyter Notebook or in the Data_Processing_Alg_Training.py file.
The .py files are for running the program and classifying your own articles.
The classifiers are all fairly accurate, both on test data and on random articles I found on the Internet and had classified. 
I built this wanting to learn more about machine learning and I'm sure it is far from being optimized.

# Running the Program
- Clone the repository or download the code
- pip install the packages in requirements.txt in a vurtual environment
- Run the Run.py file in your IDE using pyhton 3.10
- You will be prompted to paste an article and then you will get a result from each of the 3 classifiers.
- Note that the program currently can't run in the windows terminal due to how it takes user input.

# Credits
I coded this program on my own but I couldn't have done it whitout the many youtube videos on the classifiers I used, on NLP, and of similar projects. There are
too many to list but I am grateful to all who share their knowledge on the internet and allow others to learn. 

# Future plans
I plan to deploy this program to a web app in order to learn more about front end development, stay tuned!
